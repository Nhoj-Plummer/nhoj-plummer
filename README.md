<p> As a front end maverick with 3 years crafting slick UIs, I fuse aesthetic vision with technical mastery to create seamless React-powered user experiences. My designs speak for themselves, but it's the special sauce of empathy and EQ behind my Figma magic that enables me to deliver UX solutions that truly resonate. Though proud of my skills, I stay hungry to keep learningâ€”because Great isn't good enough if Better is possible.</p>
